# react-playground

Set up the jungle gym for immediate React play.

## Install

```
npm install react-playground
```

## Compatibility

`react-playground@2` is compatible with npm@3.  `react-playground@1.x` is compatible with npm@2.

## Init

```
npm init
play --init
npm install
```

Note, if you don't have `node_modules/.bin` in your `$PATH`, you should add it.  If, for some reason, you despise this, add `node_modules/.bin` in front of the command so the `play` binary can be found.

## Start

```
npm start
open localhost:3000
```
